1110540,B005CWJB5G,"I had never own a Mac before I had bought this one. I have only had my computer a few months and I have never had as many issues as I have had with Apple. My OS has crashed repeatedly by ways of the dreaded ""gray screen of death"" when having started it up. I have reinstalled OS Lion several times and since I am again experiencing issues I am planning on installing Windows 8 in hopes to not having to render the laptop completely useless. In the small windows of time that it has worked I have enjoyed the keyboard background light as well as the amazing lightless of the laptop itself but overall I will never buy a Mac again and will suggest to others not to as well.",2.0
1110541,B005CWJB5G,"Too slow for a $1400 Computer. It should come with minimum 8GB Ram.Total mess, I will be returning and purchasing a ASUS instead.  They have higher screen resolution, faster CPU and More RAM for less money. And overall ASUS is a superior brand.",1.0
1110542,B005CWJB5G,"I bought this thinking it is a good machine with good features.To start being an Apple or Mac fan can be really expensive or I should say a rip off. The productivity software, the anti-virus, the accounting software, the HDMI ports, you are looking to replace everything with this purchase as nothing that you owned before works.I agree with the graphics and some hardware superiority this machine might have over others, but I am not a gamer, and I do not focus on pictures and music a lot, so this MacBook Air goes back to Apple store after 24 hours of me having it.",1.0
1110543,B005CWJB5G,"Very please with this product. The SSD really shows its teeth even when comparing it to my Macbook Pro. The speed and portability of this Macbook Air is great, just what one needs if they need to be ultra portable or need something small. I was for a long time anti-Mac but after using them more for work and personal use, they really are great. They keep going, and keep going at the same rate they started at, quick, and efficient.",5.0

1110545,B005CWJB5G,"I admit the air comes in a sexy shape, it is very thin and light but the inside components are substandard in quality. The only moving part (the fan) breaks all the time and it is very noisy.",1.0
1110546,B005CWJB5G,"I like this. I wasn't going to get one but on black friday they had such an incredible deal I decided to get one for work. The battyer life is good when browsing the web or other low processor applications. Going on to intensive applications such as Jalbum, photoshop or imovie and it will deteriorate quickly. I still like this laptop. It is sturdy and super light.",5.0
1110547,B005CWJB5G,"I needed a laptop that I can carry and walk around with every day, use it for development, word processing and presentations. Last year I got a Lenovo U300s, and was very happy with it. Three things stood out: screen was a bit dark and image would fade at an angle, 4GB ram was low and it had an  inferior trackpad; otherwise it was a superb laptop. Unfortunately, that laptop was stolen and so I decided to finally embrace the new age of personal computing with a MB Air. I'm very happy with my choice.Pros:------ The screen is very bright, colors are vivid and can be viewed from any angle. It's probably the best quality display that I've seen on a 13"" laptop.- The SSD is very fast. Ultrabooks with a hybrid SSD are not the same. With SSD, apps open quicker, files copy faster by a factor of 4 or 5. You can go to Tom's hardware to see a detailed analysis of hybrid HDDs vs SSD storage.- Ergonomics are top notch. The lid flips open without the laptop flopping up, the entire body feels rigid, nothing flops around or moves when it's not supposed to.- The backlit keyboard is very comfortable to type on, although I do miss Pg Up/Down, Home/End and Delete buttons as a long time PC user.- Trackpad and Lion's multitouch gestures are in a class of their own. Unfortunately no PC can touch Apple here. At first I was skeptical of the new Lion features, but if you spend a few minutes learning each gesture, it actually makes the experience of working on a MB Air very enjoyable.- Thunderbolt and USB 3 finally live together. You shouldn't have to choose as a customer, and finally both are available for fast I/O to your heart's content.- 8GB ram is a plus. I run Fusion 4 w/ Win 7 without any trouble for any PC-only needs.- I'm finally starting to realize the benefits of a Mac ecosystem. Things like airplay, the local file drop on Lion, wireless syncing with an iPhone...all nice little extras that make life easier.- At 3 lbs, I leave it in my backpack and walk around with it every day, it's like carrying around a small textbook. That's enough for me to compromise on price and some performance when compared to MB Pros and some PC offerings.Cons:------ Screen resolution could be slightly higher, i.e. similar to what Asus or the MB Pro retina offer.- I miss having F-buttons that PCs offer, mainly because I do some work in Excel.- Price is up there, but you I fully expected that buying Apple and I know that I'm getting quality with instant support, no gimmicks, no bloatware.",5.0

1110551,B005CWJB5G,"The screen is absolutely terrible.  It is way too glossy.  It's now 2012, why would anyone make a glossy screen especially for a laptop that is thin and light and designed to be carried around and used in all light conditions?  Just doesn't make sense to not put a matte screen on this thing.  Also no HDMI port and only 2 USB ports make this a terrible product.  Apple, get back on track, this doesn't cut it.",1.0

1110554,B005CWJB5G,"It's &uuml;ber thin, and a great change from a macbook pro I used previously. For anyone switching from a MBP to MBA, you sacrifice a bit of gigs and rams. If you don't run heavy applications, I suggest getting an Air. They're much better if you're someone who travels a lot, like I, and have to bring their laptop with them.",5.0
1110555,B005CWJB5G,"This is the best laptop you can buy.  The biggest advantage is that it is an Apple product.  Why?  Apple makes the hardware and software, there are no other companies involved.  This gives Apple complete control and integration of the hardware and OS which is a good thing because Apple knows very well what they are doing.  The machine is super fast, smooth and quiet.  Having all flash memory makes it run like an iPhone or iPad, fast, smooth and quiet.  There is no hard drive to hiccup and start ups are blazing fast.  Apple takes great care of their software, hardware and customers so any issues that may arise will be handled by the foremost company in the technology field of today.There are really no cons to this machine.  Others may have slightly better specs, but that does not mean their product is better.  A car may have better specs on paper and yet one with lower specs may be a better drive and overall better performing machine.  You will not miss the CD drive.  If you must have one buy an external, but for daily use you wont miss it,  The style.  Super simple, well built and very modern.Apple has it dialed in, there is a reason they are number one.",5.0
1110556,B005CWJB5G,"Don't make the confusion that bigger is better.  Exactly a year ago I got this model for my wife on our 30th anniversary.  At age 71, I was concerned how she'd cope with a totally different machine.  One year later she's still loving it and better yet it's so light most hardback books weigh more.  Then add a battery that lasts longer than most will ever need - it's a winner!  Thanks to external SSD cards (the type you use in your camera), adding more memory storage is cheap.  This delight is the machine you'll find yourself grabbing first whenever you're wanting TOTAL portability plus the power we all enjoy:)",5.0

1110558,B005CWJB5G,"I just bought my 2nd MacBook Air 13"". My first one is just a few months old. I decided to treat myself by getting the newest Air, upgraded to 8gb and faster processor, and gave my other Air to my son.This is truly the cutting edge of computers. It is a least a year (maybe two) ahead of anything else on the market now. As usual, Apple is way ahead of the curve. I predict that more and more people will switch to laptops. No need for a large hard drive when everything is shifting to the cloud. No need for a CD/DVD when people are doing so much streaming. No need for an ethernet port with Wi-Fi's everywhere. No need for a lot of USB (or any) ports on a laptop when there's Wi-Fi, streaming, and cloud computing. I think the trend is towards owning a laptop (like the Air), owning a smart phone, owning an iPad, and keeping them all synced through the cloud. It's also handy to add a Nano.",5.0
1110559,B005CWJB5G,"I recently owned a Mac book pro Retina since it came out last summer.  I thought to myself, gee I would love to get a touch screen based laptop with Windows 8,  sounds pretty neat.  I like touch screen tablets.Point is,  I sold the Retina,  and bought a touch screen windows laptop,  one of the highest rated I could find.  (Lenovo Yoga 13).  When you read reviews of Laptops,  all of them have a trade off,  touch pad, build quality, keyboard etc.I had it for 2 days,  and I returned it.  I went back to debating what my next laptop should be.  So I settled on a Mac book Air 13.3 the one mentioned here,  I dont regret it.  And I never have...As soon as I opened the box,  started it up,  typed in my info.  I was home.  The build quality,  speed and attention to detail in a Apple Mac book is second to none.  And you can now run Windows 8 in 10.8.3's version of bootcamp.I am used to the Retina screen and that does show you can see the pixels,  but I know I really dont have a need for the speed and graphics or 8gb of ram the retina provided.Mac book air 13.3 with 1.8ghz Core i5 and 256 SSD with 4gb of ram:Pros:*Backlit keyboard is awesome,  the keys are solid,  easy to recognize when they register as being pressed.*Quiet,  you will never again take for granted how quiet a Mac notebook is until you get a Windows based laptop,  the fan is on  constantly and its audible with those,  to the point of annoying you.*Track Pad is amazing,  it is responsive (again you dont notice how good it is until you try the best Windows based pc).  The quality is just great.*Performance is great,  again you dont notice until you try another laptop with the same specs,  it just works.*App Store, all my apps were waiting for me in the app store once I logged in*Already up to date out of the box,  it had 10.8.3 so it must of just came from the factory*Dual band up to 300mbps wireless,  surprisingly enough the 1200 laptop from Lenovo didn't have this,  when you have 100mb+ Internet speed that gets at most 50mbps on 2.4ghz wifi,  you need 5ghz.  And Mac book air has it  so I get 110mbps+ on wifi.*The amazing balance of weight and speed is great on a Mac book air.  its fast, apps load very quickly and so do web pages.*3.0 USB ports,  when you have an external 3.0 Hard drive, the speed is as fast as an internal. (not ssd speed of course)*The mag safe quick release adapter.  It's amazing no one else has anything like this.  Yanking your expensive laptop off a table isn't exactly fun.  I never seen it happen with a mac book.*Facetime - if you have anyone with an iphone or ipad or another mac book,  facetime is nice without having to hold your phone up.*Battery life is amazing, I get 4 hours of youtube watching or watching movies on a plane.*The speakers are great for how thin they are,  and it gets really loud,  I mean its amazing and they sound as good as it gets for a laptop as thick as a USB port.*Length of the power adapter's power cord.  Its 14 feet long! with the extension attached (6 feet+ from the computer to the block and another 6feet + from block to plug),  or you can just plug the block in the wall (about 6 feet).  Other adapters from other brands are half this length (6 feet or shorter), and when you have your laptop on a Kitchen table, you appreciate that extra length,  The things Apple finds you don't even realize until you get another brand.  This attention to detail is what makes them awesome.Cons:-Windows on  mac book runs so hot temperature wise its insane.  I have seen complaints about this for the 5 years i've been using Mac books.  Why is it impossible for them to let windows properly control the fans?  Its ice cold and silent under Mac OS x unless your playing flash based video or some sort of gpu or cpu intensive task.  But Windows,  just the fact its turned on will turn the computer into a molten piece of metal.Again Apple's attention to detail,  no one has matched it.  I thought I would try out the others after 5 years of living in apple Mac Book world, and I was so disappointed with every other option I went back and I am happy.  HP and Lenovo seem to be the best Windows options,  and every one of them had huge trade off's.  Build quality, or battery life or keyboard or track pad.  Evern after years,  Apple still has all those things mastered and no one else has caught up yet.  That just amazes me.  I am talking about other laptops that are the same price.",5.0
1110560,B005CWJB5G,"The only downsides to this computer are 1) the 128 GB harddrive and 2) the lack of ability to user upgrade components such as RAM.  At first I thought the lack of optical drive would bother me but I realized almost every piece of software can be downloaded and if push comes to shove, you can buy and external optical drive for about $30.Also, the 128 GB harddrive can be expanded with an external hard drive.  The only one that really bothers me is the lack of ability to upgarde yourself.  The 4 GB of RAM is probably not enough but I didn't want to over pay from Apple to get the RAM and the price on Amazon was way cheaper than on the Apple website.Otherwise, this computer rocks and the amazing style, size and design are superb!  Worth the few extra hundred dollar premium to windows based ultra books or sleek books.",5.0
1110561,B005CWJB5G,"If you're a mac fan, and have had the iMac's, mini's, macbook, this is yet another stellar product by Apple. This is my go around macbook I use for work, out and about, etc... And it has worked great. Even does well for higher level processing such as editing home movies, photos, and even some music production. I have yet to find something this air locks up on. I could imagine gaming wouldn't be great, but basic games seem ok; angry birds, and even starcraft worked ok on the macbook air. The 13' is the way to go in my opinion, better screen area. If you go less, might as well buy a iPad....Overall, not going to lie... I'm a person who will buy an apple product anyways, it's what I've trusted all these years... so this IS a bias review. But I also have a windows samsung series 8 laptop, that has just been collecting dust, and I've browsed the ultrabook section, but wasn't thrilled. Apple just has it figured out...Pros: very thin (i got the SPECK clear case for it, just for a little bulk/grip and protection), sleek, good speed, good screenCons: none so far, guess one could say the battery life could be better, I get about 4 1/2 hours of use (constant use, videos, photos, music) which is actually pretty good for not shutting down and only having it sleepSummary: Anyone that needs something that's pretty snazzy looking, yet has the power to do what you want and the classic smoothness of operation that Apple is known for, this is the way to go. The macbook 13 vs the air really didn't have enough difference besides the weight for me to get the pro. Sure, it has the CD drive, but really, who needs a CD drive anymore??",5.0
1110562,B005CWJB5G,"Now that Macs can run Windows, I am glad I can buy Macs and get the best of both worlds.  I purchased my Macbook Air for school.  I am a Sophomore at college and I have used a Macbook Pro, an HP Laptop, and most recently an iPad.  The first two were bulky and added a lot of weight to my backpack.  I ended up leaving the laptops at home and using campus computers instead, negating the purpose of even having a laptop.Next, I tried an iPad.  While it was super easy to carry around and beautiful to use, it wasn't as functional as I'd have liked due to the restrictive software (iOS) and lack of ability to help me with programming in my computer science degree plan.I took a chance and bought the Macbook Air and was instantly relieved of these problems.  It is incredibly light, thus enabling me to carry it around in my backpack and hardly know it is there at all.  You can hold it between your thumb and finger with no problem, it is so light.  It is VERY quiet.  I rarely hear the fan come on.  The screen has a great resolution, and the newer features brought from the Macbook Pro (back-lit keyboard, for example) are a great addition.  I have a Corsair Voyager GT USB 3.0 flash drive and transferring files is insanely quick thanks to the two USB 3.0 ports.  Having one on each side helps a lot.  I have been getting comments about how nice the laptop is.  Please note, I don't use this for gaming so I can't say how powerful it really is.I have not encountered any Wifi issues as some have said.  I did have a little bit of a problem getting Bootcamp to install Windows 7 because it didn't like my USB drive for that.  I had to borrow someone else's drive but it worked a charm then.  I enjoy flipping to Windows to do my programming at school, then switching back to OSX to browse the web and watch movies.  This is the best laptop I have ever bought.-----------------------------------UPDATE: 3/31/2013The Air is still running great. I wanted to add that I have played Portal 2 and a couple of other older games on the laptop and they actually run very well. The only thing is, the fans come on and it can be a little loud once the graphics start churning out.",5.0
1110563,B005CWJB5G,"I am a long-time windows user and this is my first Mac. I've decided to switch to macs because of 1) extremely good experience with iPhones and iPads (I admit they are not perfect, but they are by far the best package I've tried, and I used to be very into gadgets until I started using iPhone/ iPad); 2) saw my roommate using it and was really impressed by the battery life and the size.It's my first week owning it and so far, all I can say is, wow... Mac is just so easy to use! I'm usually pretty good with computers, and by using all the shortcuts and gestures of the trackpad, using the laptop is just such a pleasurable experience!I recommend this 2012 Macbook Air whole-heartedly to anyone who's looking into a portable laptop (as opposed to a workstation, gaming gig, etc).",5.0
1110564,B005CWJB5G,"I always have apple products, so I can't be very helpful with those switching over, but I do love their product.  I find them intuitive.  This Air version, 13&#34; is a perfect size, very slim, lightweight and easy to travel with, but still sturdy and well-made.",5.0
1110565,B005CWJB5G,"This MacBook Air is my 5th Apple product and definitely won't be my last but I am in no way an Apple fangirl though I'm beginning to have a whole new appreciation for all of their products and the whole ecosphere, but I do recognize its faults.  I put off the purchase of a Mac laptop for at least two years trying to make do with my PC.  I bought a high-end Sony Vaio with every feature I wanted except a lighted keyboard.  Other than having to occasionally use Adobe CS and Visual Studio on Windows to do .NET development, I haven't given my old laptop a second thought since I got the Air 3 months ago.I run a Windows virtual machine on my iMac but I didn't want to adulterate this machine with it.  So, I do as much coding as I can using Sublime Text, Coda, and Espresso and only use my Windows machine when I absolutely have to open a project in Visual Studio.  I'm waiting for Adobe CS7 to come out before switching that over to Mac also.  I really like the Mountain Lion OS and am committed to becoming a true Mac user all the time.  The switch from Windows to Mac presents some paradigm shifts for long-time Windows users, and there are quite a few things to get used to especially when using ported programs such as Office for Mac, but otherwise the overall experience is very good and generally well thought-out.  One thing that amazed me was that, out of the box, I literally had this new machine up and running and connected to Dropbox and my mail, contacts and calendar from my iPhone in less than 10 minutes.  I've wrestled with new PCs for over an hour getting up and running so as you can imagine, this was a really refreshing difference.I ordered my Air directly from Apple in order to get an education discount and a back to school gift card that was a better deal than Amazon's.  I upgraded the RAM to 8GB because I knew I was eventually going to be running CS, among other things, and I didn't want to tax the life of the SSD by constantly using the swap space.  Now I really wish I had gone ahead and upgraded the SSD also since the factory software, Office, and a few other programs I've added as well as my music library has me down to around 20GB of free space, yikes.So here goes.  First, the good stuff:1) The battery life.  I am clocking 6-8 hours per charge and that includes running the screen on at least half brightness or higher, having the backlit keyboard on it's lowest light setting, and running several programs including numerous browser tabs.  I've never gotten more than about 3 hours tops off a PC laptop battery, ever, and that's being extremely miserly with consumption.2) The size and weight.  It is almost unbelievably thin and light, especially compared to my old PC laptop which wasn't necessarily huge, but still a big difference.3) The screen.  It is so bright and clear and possesses normal, natural color quality - an absolute must for web designers/developers.  Also the native resolution, at 1440x900, is more pixels in less space (13"" vs. 15.4"") than my Vaio's 1366x768.4) The trackpad.  Hands down the best trackpad any laptop has ever seen.  Your fingers glide over it so smoothly.  When I do have to use my old laptop now, the trackpad feels like someone has left tape on it too long and removed it, leaving behind the sticky stuff.  The multi-touch gesturing is amazing, convenient, and super intuitive.5) The keyboard.  I have achieved my fastest typing speeds yet on this keyboard.  I really liked the keyboard on my Vaio as it was my first PC laptop with the chicklet style keys.  This one is even better in every way possible.6) The speed.  On/off in seconds as opposed to minutes for HDDs.7) The quiet.  Noticeably missing is the sound of any processor/fan/etc.  It's soooo nice.  My Vaio's fan runs nearly constantly.  The only sound I hear right now is the clicking of my fingernails against the keys, pure bliss.8) The App Store.  If you like the App Store for iPhone, you'll very quickly come to love it for the Mac. I was able to quickly connect to some of my favorite apps on my phone and share the data between them.9) Network connections and backups.  Connecting to new networks and running backups couldn't be faster or easier.  Mac has definitely got PC beat in this area by a landslide.  Bluetooth and Wifi are flawless.  Bluetooth on my PCs has always been super spotty.10) Adding peripherals.  No need to install/download anything to connect to your printer and many other peripherals.  I've connected to printers in places I've never been before in a matter of seconds - impossible on a PC.Finally, the not-so-good stuff:1) Most programs, especially those with more mature PC counterparts, don't quite act the same as what I'm accustomed to, specifically in the area of keyboard shortcuts.  Some of them are simply missing, others require more key presses than usual.  We're talking default configuration here though there are a lot of options which can be configured in the preferences.  In this same vein, I am also having a difficult time getting used to clicking the Command key instead of the CTRL key for keyboard shortcuts, especially since my muscle memory wants to press the key that's in the control key position on the Mac which actually happens to be the control key on the Mac, it just doesn't do what a long-time PC user expects it to.2) No dedicated delete, pg up, pg down, etc. buttons.  Traditional PC-like deletion requires a press of the function key in addition to the ""delete"" key which is actually what we PC users know as the BACKSPACE key, ugh.3) As much as I love the trackpad, there is room for improvement particularly in the area of the multi-touch gestures.  It seems like it would be super easy to allow for some customization or even offer some pre-programmed convenience features like three-finger tap to cut/copy/paste, etc.  There are several apps that make this possible, which serves to indicate Apple's oversight here.4) File system organization and management takes a little getting used to coming from the Windows environment.  Also, I'm entirely out of my element with the Mac command line, and I suspect most long-time Windows users would be as well.5) Safari pretty much sucks.  I immediately installed Chrome and Firefox for testing purposes anyway but Chrome is my browser of choice.  One really frustrating thing though is that Chrome for Mac doesn't yet allow the option to open tabs from the browser bar when pressing enter like it does on the PC.6) The Mac OS runs an Apple-ized version of Java which hasn't necessarily given me any problems yet, but I am constantly getting warnings that I need to update Java when using programs like LogMeIn, GoToMeeting, and WebCT.  If I try to update Java, I get a warning that says it will overwrite Apple's Java (something I haven't had time to research yet to know whether it's good, bad, or neither).7) The aluminum casing is beautiful but is very easy to scratch and dent.  You'll want/need a cover/case/sleeve/etc.  I highly recommend theIncase Neoprene Sleeve For Macbook Air 13-Inch -  Black (CL57802).I was initially concerned that my work and school development workflow might be interrupted by going all Mac, but in reality, if anything, it's been bolstered because I absolutely am in love with this machine and since it's so portable, I take it everywhere!  If you're like me and you're torn over the decision because of the Windows development issue, you won't be sorry if you make this purchase.  Plus, Mac computers hold their value better than any other on the market so if you absolutely hate it (you won't), you can always take a (very) small loss by selling it back on Amazon or eBay.",5.0
1110566,B005CWJB5G,"I am a 43 year old lifetime PC user, and am writing this review using my Mac Air.  I still use my PC, mostly for gaming, and also for work, as we use all MS software for email, etc.  This laptop is great for portability, as I travelled home from CO to WA state with this instead of my ASUS gaming laptop this year.  Boy what a difference in bulk and weight.  As for whether Macs are a must for general PC users, I would have to say no.  But if you are on the fence, let me tell you what else I like about this little puppy compared to my PCs.Simplicity:  Learning to use a Mac effectively is kind of like knowing Spanglish, but wanting to speak fluent Spanish.  You will need to put some time and effort into it, but if you are familiar with the way computers work, it's not re-learning the system, more of a tweak to using it.  And once you do learn, Macs are far more simple and functional, with less options for doing things and more intuitive commands.Efficiency:  Just as the above reasons make a Mac easier to use, they also make things faster and more effective.  The lack of options translates into less decisions about how to tackle commands, navigating, and use of programs.  If you like being able to do one thing 10 different ways, and want to choose for yourself, then stick with a PC.  If you trust the Apple designers, and believe Apple knows what they are doing (after using a Mac, I for one do) then the Mac beats the PC for pure efficiency of time and key clicks.Portability:  Already covered up there at the top, but seriously, this thing is tiny.  I haven't had an issue with the size yet (13"" screen), but I do often find myself using the full screen mode when in browsing windows, and I haven't yet mastered navigating between them, so it's clunkier than on my PC, but I'm still learning my Spanish, so to speak.  People with a netbook or one of the newer thin laptops or the Surface will not find any advantage in using the Mac, other than perhaps computing power, but I have no experience with other comps this size, so I will leave that to someone else.Esthetics:  If you have a little extra jingle to throw around, and looks matter for your comp, apple is hard to beat.  My Air looks cool, and I do feel cool using it, even if it's only in my spare bedroom pretending to be a budding novelist (only a matter of time, and more effort than I'm putting in now :)  My sister recently acquired a Surface, and they are pretty slick as well, but I don't think they are quite the full functioning computer that a laptop is.  I may be wrong about that, and if they are, then the Esthetics advantage Apple holds may be in danger, as the Surface looks pretty slick.  Not quite as ""artsy"" but definitely cool from a high tech perspective.Bottom line:  It's a good investment for non-graphics user if you want to simplify your computer world, or you want full functionality in a very portable package. From what I've read, if you use graphics intensive programs, then the Mac is far and away the better product, but again, I will let someone more knowledgable than I speak about that.

1110567,B005CWJB5G,"Both my Macbook Air and my wife's Macbook Pro have had major wireless connectivity issues for months. Connections will slow and drop regularly. Not in a minor way but with severe regularity. The Apple message boards are full of complaints about this issue, which seems to have been caused by so called upgrades to the Operating System. (Seems to. But Apple isn't clarifying anything.) My computer has 10.8 and my wife's is 10.6. Same problem. It occurs at home and on the road. I have had my cable service checked in detail. I have switched routers and switched back. The issue persists. My internet connectivity is perfect on ethernet, horrible on wireless. My aging Windows laptop works flawlessly on my home wireless network. The Macs do not, and Apple does not seem even to have acknowledged the problem.If you have a Mac and your wireless works ok, don't upgrade your OS. Don't upgrade your computer. And for goodness sake don't switch from Windows to Mac until this is resolved.Otherwise the Air and the Pro are excellent machines. But it's a huge otherwise.",1.0

It actually has me using my iPad (3rd gen) less which is surprising.  It's just so light and the screen and battery life are great.  Retina screen would be the only improvement but I still think thats 1 1/2 - 2 years away.  I purchased a 13"" i5 / 4GB / 256GB,  its plenty fast but I decided to return it and future proof a little with a custom build 8GB RAM and 2.0 GHZ i7 processor direct from Apple.

1110575,B005CWJB5G,"I purchased both the newly updated 13"" MacBook Air and the updated13"" MacBook Prothe day they were announced at WWDC and released for sale in June 2012. After using the two machines side-by-side for a couple weeks now, I can say that the MacBook Air offers superior performance in virtually every respect to such a degree that I've pretty much stopped using my brand new MacBook Pro. Of course the Air (which I got factory upgraded to the 2.0 GHz i7 processor and 8GB of RAM) is lighter, slimmer, and sleeker than the Pro, and yes, it does have a much higher resolution display, but I was surprised just how much faster the MacBook Air is compared to the Pro is despite the Air's slower CPU clock speed. The SSD hard drive on the MacBook Air makes an enormous difference in everything from casual web browsing to video editing.Speed and Performance: Advantage MacBook AirApart from the hard drives and port configurations, the technology inside the machines is virtually identical in both the newly refreshed MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Both Pros and Airs come with either i5 or i7 Intel ""Ivy Bridge"" processors, Intel HD Graphics 4000, USB 3.0, and lightning-fast Thunderbolt ports. While the MacBook Air models are at a disadvantage to the MacBook Pro models in terms of CPU clock speeds, any performance disadvantage from the processor speed is more than made up for by the lightning fast performance of the Air's SSD hard drive, which Apple markets as ""Flash"" storage. In everyday tasks from gaming to web browsing to watching Flash movies and editing video, the MacBook Air is faster significantly faster in virtually every task. The Air boots up in less than 12 seconds while the Pro takes upwards of one minute.Screen: Advantage MacBook AirOnce you get used to the super high resolution 1440 x 900 LED display on the MacBook Air, the 1280 x 800 back-lit LED display on the MacBook Pro looks downright grainy and primitive. Simply put, once you get used to a higher resolution display, the 1280 x 800 display on the 13"" MacBook Pro just isn't acceptable. Even for simple tasks like email or word processing where you wouldn't think the resolution would matter, the graphics look grainy and pixelated, which just isn't acceptable for a pro-level laptop in 2012.Upgradability: Advantage MacBook ProOne major difference that's important to consider between the Air and the Pro is that the Pro is more flexible and adaptable in terms of upgradability. With only a screw driver and about 10 minutes of your time, you can add more memory to the Pro, replace the hard drive, and even add a second hard drive in place of the optical disc drive. The Air, on the other hand, is stuck in the configuration you purchase it in except that you can opt to replace the SSD ""Flash"" hard drive with a higher capacity drive. However, both the Air and Pro have USB 3.0 (which is five times faster than USB 2.0 and backward compatible) and Thunderbolt (which is ten times faster than USB 2.0), I see no reason to replace the Air's hard drive any time soon given how cheap external hard drives are and how fast the connection has become.Design, Weight, Portability, Battery Life, and Form Factor: Advantage MacBook AirThe MacBook Air is the most beautiful computer ever produced by man. The aluminum case is impeccably designed, almost tailored to accommodate the necessary internal components, while maintaining practical ergonomics. It's an incredibly thin, svelte, sexy little notebook. The aluminum case seems sturdy and durable, and its mechanics are very similar to the time-test unibody construction of the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro, on the other hand, is a bit of a dinosaur in its bulky circa 2006 unibody. The Pro is heavier than a half gallon of milk at 4.5 lbs, while the MacBook Air weighs in at less than 2.9 lbs. Battery life is roughly even on both machines at anywhere from 4 to 7 hours depending on workload and settings.Summary Judgement: Buy the MacBook AirSimply put, the guts of the two machines are basically the same, but the Air's SSD hard drive gives it a tremendously significant boost in performance. Sadly, the MacBook Pro's 5400-rpm hard drive leaves the machine unable to capitalize on the newest, most expensive Intel ""Ivy Bridge"" i5 and i7 processors that you're paying a $300 premium for in the newly updated Pros. If you are going to buy a Pro, invest  the extra money and get it upgraded with a SSD hard drive and get an extra external hard drive if you need additional cheap storage space for multimedia files. When you also consider the superior display, lighter weight, increased portability, and lower price of the MacBook Air, it's hard to find a reason to justify purchasing the current 13"" MacBook Pro, which to me looks like a dinosaur rapidly headed for extinction.Specs on the models compared:13"" MacBook Air (mid 2012) factory upgraded to the 2.0 GHz dual core i7 processor and factory upgraded to 8 GB RAM (1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM) with standard 256 GB SSD (""Flash"") hard drive13"" MacBook Pro (mid 2012) with 2.9 GHz dual core i7 processor, 8 GB RAM (1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM), and 750GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpmBoth feature Intel HD 4000 Graphics, 3.0 USB, Thunderbolt, 802.11n, etc.",5.0

1110581,B005CWJB5G,"First, since there is often confusion with Amazon listings vs associated reviews, I am reviewing the following Macbook Air Model:13 Inch Mid-20121.8 GHz Intel Core i5 Processor128 GB Solid State Drive4 GB DDR3 RAMI recently sold a mid-2012 13-inch Macbook Pro in order to get the Macbook Air instead.  Honestly, I don't know why I didn't buy the Air to begin with, but you live and learn.  My main use for the Air is teaching at church.  I am always looking for ways to consolidate what I have to carry back and forth between church and home, both in size and weight, so the Air helps immensely in both those areas.  I still cannot get over how thin and light it is, esp. in light of its amazing performance.  My main use is PowerPoint presentations with hundreds of complex animations and graphics and HD video.  Performance is the same as the MB Pro was, which was flawless.  And it still has the backlit keyboard, which is very nice when the lights have to go out in the room.I do not miss the integrated SuperDrive one bit.  The CD/DVD sharing over Wi-Fi works flawlessly for me (for the few programs I have on that media).  The flash architecture is also amazingly fast and snappy.  I still can't get over how instantly the OS boots up and shuts down.  It almost seems fake after years of using traditional hard drives :-)I love the universal nature of the Thunderbolt port, and of course USB 3.0 (x2 ports) is a great plus.  The SD card slot on the 13 inch model is also handy.  The only reason I didn't opt for the 11-inch model is because the native resolutions on that model don't work well with my WXGA (16:10 aspect ratio with native 1280x800 resolution) projector.My only (minor) complaint is that I wish the entire front face of the Air's screen was glass like the iMac and MC Pro.  So much easier to clean.  The bezel around the Air's screen makes it harder to get the dust completely off, as it will want to gather around the edges, esp. at the corners.  The black border on the iMac and MB Pro also provides a better contrast with the screen.And I have no doubt that I will eventually use the Air for music production and photo editing on the go which I mainly do on my iMac currently.  And this notebook has the processing power, memory, and graphics to easily handle these applications as well.  I envision quite a few years of more-than-satisfactory use out of this notebook.  I feel like I've got a machine that I should have paid at least $2000 for, but I actually paid closer to $1000 (well, if we're rounding to the nearest thousands place, LOL).",5.0

I quickly fell in love with this laptop and while I have an iMac desktop at home, I find myself often resorting to this MacAir as it is just plain fun to use.I bought this unit as I could get the 256 solid state drive and it has a SD input slot. I bought a 32 GB fast SD card and formatted it for Mac (not necessary but I did it anyway) to use for data storage. I placed it in the SD card slot on the side of the laptop. I also use Dropbox for data storage whenever necessary as well. Consequently storage or ""drive"" size has been no problem.I cannot say enough good things about this computer. But I must admit that one of the factors that makes it almost perfect is the Apple ecosystem that permits all of my systems to stay in complete sync whether they be my iPad, iMac, this MacAir, or my wife's iPad or MacBook Pro.

For example, I occasionally hook up an aux 19in monitor to the MBA and the system remembers the configuration each time, no tweaking of the settings like I usually do with my work laptop. The boot up time on this device is fast, still under 10 secs each time, same with shut down. Finally a computer that I can turn on and off on a whim.

That's faster than a camel with a roman candle in it's ass.  I have put aside my issues with Apple.Build quality is excellent, though it is missing a network port and requires a $30 adapter if you want to hardwire to the internet.  Unlike early models, this one has a Thunderbolt port so you can connect it to another computer in Target Disk Mode.  That's important. Also, unlike early models, it has an SSD, which is apparently very fast.  2 USB3 ports make it very well-rounded; a lot of ultrabooks are still using USB2.I've seen a number of netbooks and ultrabooks, but this one is the fastest, by far.  If you're a Windows guy, like me, you can run Parallels or VMWare Fusion.  Cost is a little higher than you'll find in a comparable ultrabook, and if you actually need to fix something on it, you're in trouble.  These are damn near impossible to disassemble by anyone other than Apple; I knocked off a star rating for that.

Despite being an Apple guy generally (4S, iPad, 27 iMac) I cheaped out and bought a HP Envy 4.  My justification was similiar performance at half the cost.After spending time with a group including a MacBook Pro 13, a Dell ultra book,  my HP ultra book and a couple of recent vintage 13"" Airs I saw the error of my ways.  Display, keyboard, general speed, sleep, start up,  and battery life are all better on the Air.  The much better display and battery life alone justify the additional cost.  The track pad is also outstanding as is the keyboard and general build quality,  I exchanged the Envy for the Air along with a significant payment which ended up being the best money I've spent in a while.Make sure you update to OS 10.8.2.  Not only do you get (with the related firmware upgrade) true 8 hour battery life so long as you keep brightness at half way (which is as bright as  the Envy at 75%) you get the ability to dictate pretty accurately into most applications.My only complaint to date is that the OS Email server has no ability to limit email uptake on accounts like the iPad. I have only found one program to date that I could not get in a Mac OS flavor and Office 2011 for Mac is a superior product to the PC version.

It arrived in eight days, and as always, it was beautifully packaged.Here are some my observations after owning it for about a month:- The multitouch trackpad is one of my favorite features. It is intuitive and much better than a mouse/scrollwheel. Going back to a Windows computer actually felt a little weird because I didn't have the multitouch gesture controls (e.g. swiping to go back in the web browser or two finger zoom). The keyboard has a nice feel to it and is quite quiet.- The computer boots up in 10 - 15 seconds, which is around 3 to 4 times faster than my friend's 2009 MacBook Pro. And the Air usually shuts down in 3 seconds. Waking up from sleep is almost instantaneous. All of this is possible because the Air has a SSD whereas most laptops today have traditional hard drives.- Wi-fi connects really fast. I can visit a website right after boot up/wakeup.- The Air is relatively quiet. The only time I usually hear the fan is after I have been streaming a video for a while. Even then, you don't hear the fan for long.- FaceTime looks much better with the 720p camera in the Air compared to the new iPad.- The speakers are solid. If I have computer playing music downstairs, I can still hear it upstairs. And turning up the volume doesn't distort the sound. Of course, the computer speakers pale in comparison to my Logitech Z-2300's.- GeekBench score of around 6150.- The appstore makes installing software much easier.- It's easy to plug in a monitor and use my computer with the lid closed (clamshell mode). You'll need to plug in a keyboard and mouse.- The Air is beautiful and light. It was almost too nice to use at first.- The battery charges pretty fast - it's at 22% right now and OS X estimates that it'll take an hour and 16 minutes to charge the rest of the battery.- Some reviewers and users have complained about the MagSafe 2 power connector (they like the first one more). As a first time Mac owner who haven't experienced the MagSafe 1, all I can say is that it hasn't been a problem for me, though my Air pretty much stays on my desk all day long.But it's not perfect:- I like my screen to be bright but based on my estimations, the battery won't last 7 hours if the screen is set to the brightest setting.- The bottom left corner of the trackpad is much lower than the other three corners of the trackpad. I don't think it'll be a big deal, but it'd be nice if it was perfectly aligned, especially considering how much Macs cost.- Two USB ports aren't enough, especially if you plan on using clamshell mode a lot. Since I don't have a USB hub, I have to exit clamshell mode whenever I wanted to plug in my external hard drive or print something.- Minecraft froze on me twice.Not Apple's fault:- Chrome is my favorite browser but I can't use it right now because of some bug that causes Lion to freeze up when Chrome is used. (See update below.)I'm still figuring out some things in Lion but overall, I'd give it 4 and a 1/2 stars! Recommended.Update (7/4): I downloaded Chrome after Google came out with an update for it. I haven't had any issues so far.Update (7/21): I've stuck with Safari because it feels snappier than Chrome.Update (7/29): I downloaded and installed Mountain Lion. Dictation is my favorite new feature (Safari's unified URL/search bar is my second favorite). Even with speakers playing music less than a foot away from my Air, the mic picks up what I'm saying quite accurately. I'd give accuracy a B+/A-. See my example below. And I recently had issues with videos buffering really slowly, though I don't know if it's the modem/router's fault. The problem seems to be fixed after the Mountain Lion update.Update (9/1): I have Avast Free Antivirus installed and it's been causing some issues. When I shut down the computer, it automatically restarts it and I get a report saying there was some sort of kernel panic. This usually happens once or twice a week. I don't think this is Apple's fault though. On another note: Using an external monitor along with your Air's monitor doesn't require you to have the power adapter plugged in but using the Air in clamshell mode does require the adapter to be plugged in. Kind of dumb if you think about it. You'd think that clamshell mode uses less power than supporting two monitors.Update (9/12): I updated Avast and haven't had the restart issue since. it's also interesting to note that when I use FaceTime while blasting music from an external speaker ~2 feet away, the other person can't hear the music but can hear me.Update (10/28): I had to bring my Air into the Apple store because of an issue with my screen - if you looked at it from an angle, there was a white/bluish spot that wouldn't go away. Scheduling an appointment at the Genius Bar (my first ever) was easy and it started right on time, even at 6:30pm on a Friday evening. The Apple Genius took a quick look at it and determined it was an issue with the interior of the screen. And instead of fixing it, which they said would've taken at least 10 days, they replaced my machine with a top-of-the-line 13"" Air with a 2.0 GHz processor and 512GB SSD (my old machine had a 1.8GHz processor and the standard 128GB SSD) at no charge. Since they gave me a brand new computer, I got a new MagSafe 2 charger too. The retail difference between the two machines is over $700. On top of that, they ""refunded"" my AppleCare and restarted it from the day I took it in. To say the least, I'm an extremely satisfied customer.Update (11/17): My new MBA (see the update on 10/28) seems to be quieter than my original MBA. I don't hear the fan as often, even after streaming videos for a while.---Dictation example [Nothing after the colon will be edited except for punctuation/capitalization. Things in brackets are not dictated]: This is an example of the dictation feature in Mountain Lion. I am speaking about one and a half feet away from the mike in a room that is relatively quiet. The only background noise is coming from a different room. I am talking relatively slowly right now so let's see how well the dictation feature works when I talk little faster and with the music in the background.[Turned music on, speakers are about 2 1/2 to 3 feet away. The volume is set at 25% on the speakers and 50% in OS X]Okay, no music playing in the background and I'm talking a little faster. I would say it is still pretty accurate. I think the dictation feature is pretty useful. However, I think it would be pretty awkward to use in public or at work. The best place to use it would still be at home in private. Next I'm going to read awesome tests on the right side column in a normal speaking rates with the music still playing in the background.[Begin reading random text]What makes a good review?Be detailed and specific but when you wanted to know before you purchase the product?

Don't get mr wrong, if you upgrade, you will see a performance increase.  But could not see a $300 difference between the imac i5 vs i7.  Hence, I would expect the same with the Mac air.  But we a talking $300 plus.  If you buy the base model, it's $100 less then apple store, and if your in a state with no sales tax burden, the base is a great buy.  The quality of the air is amazing.  For me it will replace my ipad, even thou I still like my ipad, the mac air does it all.  As for the air vs the pro, for a college student , the pro might be a better choice as a sole computer.

1110612,B005CWJB5G,"I upgraded from a 2010 HP Envy 14 to the 13"" MacBook Pro about 3 weeks ago. I tinker at a basic level, so I opted to purchase a SATA III SSD and 2x4GB 1600MHz RAM on my own and installed it. So, I had an upgraded MBP 13"" I was very proud of.Over the next week, I came to realize I should probably return the SSD, RAM, and MBP for a BTO MacBook Air with 8 GB of RAM. This was based on the following:1) Lighter Weight: I carry my laptop everywhere I go, often making 3 or more trips with the laptop in my bag. The extra 1.5 lb. from the MacBook Pro makes a difference to me, and I'm not a small guy at all.2) Better resolution: The MBP 13"" resolution maxes out at 1280x800. The 1440x900 on the MBA is more functional and allows better detail useful for work. Buyers should be aware that the MacBook Pro 13"" has a better color gamut though - intensive Photoshop work requiring color accuracy might be better on the MBP.3) Sufficient RAM: Running a memory clearing app (Clear Memory) showed me that I hover right at 4GB of RAM usage in my daily tasks, mostly involving Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook on Windows Office 2011 for Mac on top of 5-15 open Chrome browser tabs. Getting 8GB of RAM would put me in the clear, meaning I would never need or use the maximum of 16GB allowed by the MacBook Pro.4) Comparable performance: The lower clockspeed and voltage of the i5 on the MBA had me concerned at first, but most benchmarks show the MBP i5 outperforming the MBA's i5 by only about 5-10%. Since I did nothing that required that additional speed and the MBP i5 seemed plenty zippy to me, I decided that the MBA's i5 wouldn't be a noticeable downgrade in performance.5) Sufficient disk space: 128GB is plenty for me. I access most of my work files from a shared server and store videos/photos/music on an external HDD to save space anyway.Basically, I came to the conclusion that buying the MacBook Air upgraded to 8GB for $100 was a better bang for the buck, with sufficient future proofing, when compared to buying a stock 13"" MacBook Pro with user-upgraded SSD and RAM.I got my MacBook Air in the mail last week and returned my MacBook Pro. I haven't looked back - the performance feels identical to me, packed into a tighter and more portable shell.",5.0
1110613,B005CWJB5G,"Going from a White Macbook circa 2008 to the 2012 Macbook Air is a massive leap forward in technology for me. The big question is deciding which one will be best for you: The 13"" Macbook Pro or the 13"" Macbook Air.Things I like:It's fast! I plan on using this when I travel for Office, Adobe Lightroom and other photography applications. I'm able to move quickly, even when shuffling around hundreds of photos in Lightroom. This is remarkably different from my old Macbook.The SSD. Absolutely fast. Bootup/shutdown/restart times are in seconds. Yes, it's pricy, but I love it.Solid build. It feels much like other Macbook Pros, despite the thinness. Yes, it feels like it'll be a magnet for scratches, so I'm off to find a case/skin.Opposite side USB ports! The most annoying thing about my Macbook (old White, new MBP as my office computer) is that there's not enough spacing between the USB ports, so a chunkier flashdrive and another USB device won't fit. Now I don't feel like I have to choose what gets plugged in.USB 3.0. I've got enough USB 3.0 flash drives and the speed increase will be noticeable. Thunderbolt technology is supposed to be a lot faster, but a lot more expensive and quite frankly, cost-prohibitive.Weight: I've gotten used to heavier laptops so this feels downright thin. Thin enough that I don't notice it in my bag.Screen resolution: 1440x900 gives me more real estate than the 1280x800 of the 13"" Macbook Pro. The screen was bright and vivid.---Things I don't like:Non-upgradeable: So much for adding more RAM down the road.New Magsafe power connector: This might cause an issue with places that have older Macbooks as well and determining which is which. That's what labels are for.Aluminum case: It's beautiful but I'm feeling worried that I'm going to scratch it.Software update: 350MB worth of fixes out of the box. Ugh.---Sound. It's decent enough - it seems like any other laptop's audio that I've ever used. If you're serious about audio, you'll have external speakers (or even pair it up with Airplay speakers.)Battery: I got about 6 hours in a torture test of watching video while surfing the web on WiFi. It's pretty decent and within the 5-7 range that Apple stated.DVD drive: I don't miss it. I thought I would, but I don't. It just adds weight and bulk to the computer.The webcam is also a higher resolution 720p camera. It's quite nice, but now the downside is that during Facetime, my friends and family can see my ugly self more clearly. Also, early adopters won't have the computer come with the newest version of OS X - Mountain Lion. That will come in mid/late July. It's nice that this will come gratis to those who bought early.The big question is Macbook Air or Macbook Pro? It comes down town a number of issues. If this will be your primary computer, then Macbook Pro is the way to go. The MBP is a faster computer with more storage and an optical drive. If you plan on doing any high-end computing, you'll notice the difference. If this is going to be a secondary computer or if weight is the deciding factor, then the Macbook Air is for you. Either way, you can't go wrong.",5.0

1110616,B005CWJB5G,"Our family collectively owns at least one of nearly every Apple device.  All of these devices have great features however come with a number of costs: counter-intuitive functions; arbitrary restrictions; software updates that make major changes without warning or explanation and almost zero instructions.  Why I thought purchasing a MacBook Air when my Asus netbook died was a good idea is a question I am still pondering.  I have never owned a Mac computer & I expected a learning curve. But right out of the box I had to call support because I was not aware the Trackpad is also the &#34;Enter&#34; button. Gee, thanks Apple for making me feel like a complete idiot.  The new MacBook Air has a magnetic power cord which absolutely trumps all of Apple's previous idiotic decisions.  The power cord constantly falls out during use & is easily knocked out when not in use if accidentally bumped. Really, really terrible & a constant source of frustration which alone is a reason not to purchase this laptop.  Recently, after installing an Apple update my computer began asking me for a keychain password. I have never created a keychain password so I had no idea what that password could possibly be.  I had to use my iPhone to access apple.com because I couldn't access Safari on my computer due to not knowing this mysterious keychain password.  After spending many frustrating minutes just trying to locate the phone # for support I reached a recording indicating support was closed. I hunted around the internet & thankfully found instructions on how to delete the keychain password which finally allowed me to use my computer properly again. But WHY?!!! was I put through this frustration? There are dozens of other issues with the MacBook but another more frustrating one is with Safari. Deleted cookies continue to reappear no matter how many times you delete them. I had to download a 3rd party software program to circumvent this as there is no Apple fix to this problem.  I am not a fan of Apple. I think the company is arrogant & assumes its products are so great its customers will happily jump through all of its complicated hoops just to use its products.

I'm serious, go into an electronics store, and try out the trackpads on other ultrabooks and you will be immediately struck with the feeling of amazement on how such a simple part of a computer can make or break an immersive experience.

Sure, OSX does take a bit to learn when switching from a Windows OS, but in the end it honestly is more efficient at doing the things you love doing (surfing, writing e-mails, watching videos etc.)Overall this is a superb laptop.

I took the plunge since he stated Parallel 7 can allow you to run windows on mac. After 2 weeks of use this has to be one of the best ultra books  I ever used. Thin, light, and powerful with the option of windows. if you just want something simple Mac os is easy for average users simple clean and easy but if you want a power pc that is light this is a good purchase at max specs. I use my windows software with no issues and the mac side has better development software for pictures, movies, and office than windows. A great buy for it's size and features worth every penny. Just on thing expensive accessories but it is worth the investment.",4.0

1110635,B005CWJB5G,"Ok let's get a couple things out of the way first and foremost so this review is PERFECTLY understood by anyone that stumbles across it.1.  I'm an avid gamer and I play my games on a custom PC running Windows 7 Professional2.  I have neither desire nor expectations concerning GAMING on this MacBook Air (ok, MAYBE minecraft or Civilization 4 and/or 5Now that we're clear on that, I absolutely LOVE this machine.  I have Microsoft Office University (4 year license) and run Office on my PC as well as my Mac and have had ZERO issues going back and forth between PC/Mac.  Something may come up down the road because the PC runs Office 2013 and the Mac runs Office 2011 but so far I've had NO ISSUES at all.  I love that.  I don't always want to sit on the couch and use Office.  Sometimes I want to sit at my desk and work with Office.  I have the best of both worlds here as far as I'm concerned.  No, this is not a MS Office review so let's move on.The MacBook Air boots from POWERED DOWN to FULLY OPERATIONAL in less than 10 seconds.  It boots from SLEEP mode to FULLY OPERATIONAL in 2 to 3 seconds.  Now this is a brand new machine and all I have installed is Office and 5 or 6 other app's so far but at this moment the speed and the super light mobility of the MacBook Air has made my life so much easier...I use my iPad mini during lecture to take handwritten notes on my Professor's 'Powerpoint' slides (not actually Powerpoint but Apple's version, I forget the name) because I can sketch drawings and such with ease.  I send those notes to my Cloud/Dropbox/Google Drive and when I get home I work with them on the Mac OR PC.The keyboard is backlit and high quality regarding key responsiveness.  I like the 'chicklet' style.  It doesn't have a full size numpad but being a great typist it doesn't bother me at all.  The aluminum body/case or whatever you call it is tight and strong.  It feels strong.  If you've held a cheap half plastic laptop in your hands you know what I mean.  The Air is solid.  The screen looks fantastic and clear.I haven't even connected a mouse to it yet because I haven't needed it.  The touchpad/trackpad/whatever works great, stock, right out of the box.  Long time Mac users list an app as a MUST HAVE that lets you reassign a gazillion new gestures to the pad and I'm going to download that next but I had to comment on it anyway because as I said, this is my first Mac, and I'm impressed with the touchpad.  I've been using a hot rod gaming mouse for the last 20 years and I say this honestly... I don't miss it.  I haven't needed it, at least not yet.  The built in WiFi is running great right out of the box.  I have a Netgear router that does N protocol and my Mac zips right along surfing the net and downloading fairly large files.Well, what more to say?  I love this machine.  Super light, super quick boot up/refresh from sleep and it has a great keyboard.  The only drawback I can think of is that I wish you got a little bit more for your $ from Apple but this is just my opinion.  What I mean is that I bought a 128 GB model and I wish that for the price I could've gotten a 256 GB.  Honestly, if I could've afforded it RIGHT NOW, I'd have gotten the highest capacity Solid State Drive that they offer.  I'm going to guess that most Apple customers feel this way as well but what are we gonna do?The bottom line is this:  This machine is light, fast, sturdy, stylish, easy to transport, and rock solid when it comes to running all the software I need to use.*THIS IS NOT A FANCY LOOKING GAMER MACHINE*This is a great laptop for college students and, for lack of better words, ADULT computing.Simply put, &#34;I love it&#34;.I hope my review helps somebody make a good decision about whether or not they buy the product.",5.0
1110636,B005CWJB5G,"This computer replaced my wife's 2008 unibody Macbook.  That computer never needed repair, and the only changes we made to it were a replacement of 5400-rpm HD with a 256 GB Samsung 830 SSD and the battery, both last year.  The SSD in the older 2 GHz CoreDuo made a substantial difference in overall speed, but we decided to sell it off this year and get her a brand new Air.We're both very glad we did.PRO's:--Freakishly lightweight--Typical (read: excellent) Apple build quality--Apple-branded SSD means Power Nap works; nice to have Time Machine backups run even if she's closed the lid--The 1.8 GHz i5 CPU is nice, without the heat of an i7--Glad to see integrated Intel HD4000 graphics offer excellent performance for everyday computing (was a bit concerned about that prior to purchase)--Screen is less affected by glare than the glassy, glossy 2008 unibody display--Battery life is excellent--Runs OS X :)CON's:--Well, yes, it's pricier than a crappy and unusable Windows 8 laptop...  but it's not horribly more expensive when more accurately compared to Windows 8 &#34;Ultrabooks&#34; of similar screen size and battery life--Being an Air, lacks an integrated optical CD/DVD drive; not an issue for most (or us)--Default shipping configuration includes only 4GB RAM--and can *not* be upgraded--Screen bezel is not black, but of the same aluminum used in the construction of the rest of the chassis.  Doesn't sound like a big deal except it's a bit jarring at first--at least it's taken a while for my wife's eyes to adjust...BOTTOM LINE:--Very glad we upgraded my wife's 2008 unibody to this new 13&#34; Air.  Plenty of storage space, and the i5 CPU runs all her applications with ease.  No issues whatsoever with Office 2011, Firefox w/many open tabs, and VMware Fusion 5 running a Win7 VM.--Take note that this MBA utilizes the newer &#34;Magsafe 2&#34; power connector; thankfully, adapters to allow older Magsafe1 power adapters are inexpensive and easy to connect, so it's really a non-issue.--System and battery performance is excellent.A great laptop overall.

1110637,B005CWJB5G,"I ordered this on Monday and the price dropped US30 a day after, and Amazon refund the difference after I email them. Great serviceI use this laptop mainly for school, and in home I usually use my PC which has a larger screen and more softwares. So battery life is important to me. I browse and type notes every day for about 2hrs on this Air and two days later it is still more than 50% left. So this laptop can easily lasts me 8hrs with screen brightness lower down.I am new to Mac and I found this laptop a pleasure to use.

1110641,B005CWJB5G,"I recently purchased the 13"" 2012 Macbook Air with 256GB hard drive. I've spent a good amount of time with it. These are my first impressions.Not surprisingly, the first thing I noticed was that it's very light weight. When you are traveling, and picking up and moving your laptop often, having something that's lightweight is appreciated.The next obvious characteristic is that it's very slim and compact. Unless you are fortunate enough to be flying business class, or first class, you'll be mobbed up with the rest of us average joes in coach class. There is little room on that tray table. I tried using a 15"" alienware gaming laptop once on coach, and I made myself look the fool. This will fit within the confines of your crammed seat. Even if you're a lanky 6'1 guy like me.Battery life is excellent. If you are on an international flight, a flight with a layover, or on a long road trip or train ride, you will need every minute of battery life you can get. This will net 5-7 hours depending on what you're doing, and how low you can tolerate the screen brightness being.Shutdown, Boot up, sleep, and awake times are blazing, blazing fast. Perhaps the fastest of any commercial grade laptop? This is good for a laptop because you may very well find yourself using the laptop in small spurts of time, and you'll need to put it in sleep, and wake it up more often than you would a desktop machine.Another great thing is the solid state drive. This is what gives the Air it's long battery life, and its impossibly sleek dimensions, but the great thing about solid state hard drives is that they are much more reliable than optical hard drives, especially in laptops, where they experience drops, shock, and impact more than desktops. Even a minor bump has the capability to put an optical hard drive out of commission.I remember having original iPods that had optical hard drives, and I always had problems with them. I have owned every iPod Touch generation since its first release, and not one has ever had a hard drive issue, since they all use solid state storage.So you have all these great features that lend themselves well to the purposes of a laptop. The keyboard is the best I have ever used on a laptop. Keys are well spaced, and have a crisp feel. Typing is super accurate, and the adjustable backlit keys are a welcome feature to a nightowl like myself. The track pad is HUGE. I couldnt ask for any more real estate, and I have unusually long fingers too.I spent some time learning all of the trackpad gestures, and once you learn them, web surfing, file browsing, and viewing pictures will be faster, and more pleasant. I love being able to swipe instead of pressing my browsers forward and back button. When I go to a website that has tiny text, I pinch out, and increase the font size quickly and effortlessly. I rely on clicking and scrolling on a mouse less. You accomplish tasks faster.The screen is sharp, vibrant, and gorgeous. The brightness level goes high, which you will need if you ever use it outdoors on a sunny day. But make sure to set the brightness as low as you can if you are running on the battery.The laptop is as quiet as a ninja in the night. When doing basic tasks like web browsing, or listening to iTunes, or viewing pictures, its near silent. When you are running hardware intensive programs or 3D gaming, the fan starts going, but it is still pretty quiet.Even though it has integrated graphics, this laptop is still capable of running some pretty good looking modern games at moderate settings. You can run Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, Battlefield 3, MW3, Grand Theft Auto IV, and Assassins Creed on medium settings with acceptable framerates. To me, that's impressive for a super thin laptop that doesn't have a dedicated GPU.I considered the Macbook Pro because of it's more powerful specs, but in the end, i'm confident that i'll be happier with the Air. The performance meets my needs, and the sleekness, lightweight, style, and lower price give it the edge.I have used retina displays on the iPad and iPod Touch, and I know how gorgeous it is, but still there arent very many OSX apps and websites that utilize the retina display, so I don't feel that I am missing much. Plus the Retina display demands more power, and that means more battery consumption. Still, this non retina display is still sharp and beautiful.If I absolutely needed a macbook with the best hardware, I would have chose the Pro, but for my needs, the Air handles the things I need.As far as downsides go, I like the previous magsafe power adapter better. It was thinner, and less prone to accidentally being disconnected.Like all of Apple's computers, the price isn't cheap. I can't say that you're getting a bargain. But i'm willing to pay more for a good product. I think it's worth the price. And it helps that Apple products have the best resale value of any electronics brand.I don't know how tough and durable the laptop is, since I haven't dropped it, or used it in harsh conditions for long periods of time, but I have had good luck with macs in the past. No serious hardware failures so far. And I love the aluminum enclosure, which is stronger, feels better, and is much more classy than your typical plastic bodied laptops.This is what a laptop should be!",5.0
1110642,B005CWJB5G,"Let me start off by saying I've been a Windows user for 10+ years, and ""thought"" windows was the best out there and the easiest to use.  Ask me a day before I bought this computer, and I would swear nothing was better than Windows when it came to operating systems.  About a week after getting the system, and I'm seriously considering never buying a windows PC again.  If you are looking for your first mac then the MBA is perfect.I've had a iphone since January 2010 and its the best phone I have ever had.  Bought a iPad 2 last year because I wanted a travel device to watch movies on and play games on.  Then decided I'd like to trade in my iPad 2 and maybe upgrade to a Macbook to give it a try.  Loved everything Apple has made before then so I thought its only fair to try the OS and a computer from them.BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE.  There I said it.I will admit for the first few days, I hated it, everything was backwards from windows and just seemed so foreign.  Some reason thought never crossed my mind to send it back though.  Keep struggling with the OS but slowly starting to become better at using it and then after I got most of the shortcuts down and how everything works down.  I started to slowly like it then started to love it.  Everything on Mac is about being as user friendly as possible.  Once you get it down, I doubt anyone would really given the choice go back to a PC.I bought this not only to try but to replace my iPad 2 as i've said above, I wanted something with high portability while still performing extreme task and staying quick and smooth when I needed it to be.  My main computer is aAlienware AM18XR2-8728BK 18-Inch Laptop (Black)from Dell, its ""technically"" a laptop but its really a portable desktop (I know that doesn't make much since), because on battery power it can't do much of anything, everything lags and playing games are out of the question.  But when it is plugged in then I can play literally any game on the market with settings maxed out.  So that is my reason for getting this laptop other than a replacement for the iPad and trying Mac OS, I needed a portable computer for the everyday task.  Don't get me wrong my Alienware is great and I highly recommend them to Gamers but its not portable even though its a laptop, its about 2 inches thick and is really bulky.The real question is what will my next laptop be?  I can't see the future but right now I would say I would be looking at Apple MacBooks before any other computer company, sad they discontinued the 17 inch models but still I'll look at them first.If this will be your first Mac, quit second guessing yourself you will love it and then start asking why you didn't do this earlier.",5.0
1110643,B005CWJB5G,"I am techno-impaired and this is for those who follow my suit.PROS:Unbelievable speed. I thought my MacBook Pro was fast! So far (one day!), there has been almost zero time between web links. Almost spooky.Color, fonts, picture, etc. is superb. Like you could step into the screen.Light as a feather.Hard to believe but the newest version is cheaper than my old MacBook Pro. Only thing I can figure is that there are less gigs for memory. However, my old MacBook Pro had 256 GB (I think) and I never used more than 60 so it was a no brainer to take the less expensive AirBook.CONS:Really only one but a big one for me. You need to revamp all your accessory cords, etc. You will need to purchase (be sure to follow the webpage to the bottom for the proper accessories) in order to backup/transfer/and even charge (MagSafe is different) your Air. On the other hand, the USB3 is lightening fast so it's not like you have to run and make a pot of coffee if you are transferring data. Because I did not have these accessories at the time of purchase (I told you I was techno-impaired) I had to use my Airport to transfer data from old to new laptop. Took six hours.",4.0

The ability to download whatever you need is a plus in my book.  Speaking of books,  the macbook air is smaller, lighter than any book I have carried.  The weight is awesome. The size, the layout, just works great.  I recommend this laptop for anyone that is concerned about size and weight.  It is the perfect size.  Amazon always delivers.

1110648,B005CWJB5G,"Sitting around typing on my macbook air, with a mac mini near and the newest macbook pro nearby,...Ive used this Macbook air now for nearly 2 years, believe or not, its speakers are louder and clearer than the MBP (unless you install the BOOM application to boost volume), and the screen is far superior, not in my opinion, but apple inc. itself admits that even a 2 year old Macbook Air has a superior/sharper screen (samsung made) than the screen on the NEW non-retina Macbook pros. If the SSD 6 seconds to boot doesnt impress you about the MB Air, then the fact that its a SMOKING FAST computer that weighs in right at the level of an IPAD, ....if you want to turn on your computer and do something REAL FAST and do a shutdown and run along in life, then ONLY the Macbook AIR is a go.All the power of a desktop, but FASTER (ssd drive).....lite as an IPAD, easy to pack around without bruising your shoulder. I must have heard at least a 1000 people lament ""jeez, I wish I'd bought an AIR instead of my MBP!"".  No optical drive? Who cares, stick your torrent movies on a $70 1TB HD and pack it around.Its pathetic and laughable that anyone complained about 128GB of HD space when a 1TB portable drive is now around $65! Insanity. Just get a Macbook AIR, you'll be glad you did.The Macbook AIR really is the 'all future laptops will be somewhat like this'., and thats a fact. Conventional HD are slowing dying out as SSD become cheap, and the notion of a MBP in ANY flavour, even the Retina, is a joke. The Retina MBP is useless unless youre a pro photographer or plan on video editing, since it has NO optical drive, you have absolutely and utterly NO purpose in owning a Retina display laptop, NONE.And as far as relative to the MBP retina: As many new Retina MBP users have recently lamented ""hey, my old macbook air is running faster than my new Retina MBP!?""",5.0
1110649,B005CWJB5G,"I purchased two of these at Christmas.  I really love these Laptops!.  They are very well made!.  They are easy to set up, do not crash, they're fast and a joy to use.  I can not beleive that Apple can put this much computer in a package as light and powerful as this.  Just to be clear on a couple of things, I and my family are long time users of DOS/ Windows operating based computers.  We all know that with a windows based poerating system, the user is always having to &#34;fiddle&#34; with a setting, defrag, clean up or tune up the system.  This does not seem to be the case with these Apple units. In fact I also own an I phone and the Air Port extreme, all with no issues.  I purchased a Mac Laptop for a family member ten years ago.  To this day it has not had the first hardware or software issue.  I have another family member that purchased a desk top and an I pad at the same time and again, not one issue.  I might add that when I purchaced the Mac Book Air, I was on my third Dell during the time the one family member was on and still is on the first Laptop.  This is what I have learned from this purchace.1.  Apple, well done on the MacBook Air!2. Apple, well done on the AirPort Extreme!3. Apple, well done on the I phone!  I have the 4S.4. For those of you who for some reason like to bash Apple, well...... grow up.  I watched other people use their products for years before I ever purchased the first Apple product.5. I would never ever buy another computer  that did not have a SSHD.  It makes a world of differance6. I have never had a lap top that will run seven hours continuiously off of one battery charge.  This Mac Book Air will do that.7.  I installed Office Mac on two Mac Book Airs, and I have not had any issues.Anyone looking at a laptop, should take a serious look at Apple's offerings.  Like me, you may be asking yourself why you had not made the switch sooner.  Again I say, Well done Apple!",5.0
1110650,B005CWJB5G,"The current ""Ivy Bridge"" Macbook Air line is hard to find fault with.  As long as you keep the SSD configuration at 128GB it's not significantly different in price from a comparable quality ultra book on any OS.  If you want a precision metal case, long battery life, and a fairly hi-res display (1440x900 on the 13-inch model) in under 3 pounds you're looking at $1200+ on Windows too.Having USB 3.0 now is nice since hard drive sustained transfer speeds have long outpaced USB 2.0 and Firewire.  If you're planning to use virtualization like VMWare 5 or Parallels I recommend going with the 8GB RAM option which only adds $100 to the price.Note that you can't change anything in this computer yourself - hard drive nor memory, and there's no optical drive so buy what you think you'll need even if eventually.  For those so-inclined, the battery is user-replaceable after your warranty runs out but that's all that may ever find its way onto the table.  There's no wired ethernet on this model but you can get an external gigabit interface for about $30.  The built-in Wifi works on 2.4 and 5 GHZ and maxes out at 300Mbps because it has two antennas.Compared to my previous Macbook Pro 13-inch, this provides about twice the computing power using half the energy (=almost no heat) and 1/3 less weight.  An optical drive isn't something I think many people get much use out of any more so giving it up wasn't a sacrifice.In daily use it barely gets warm, the lit keyboard feels great, the sound is good - especially considering how thin this computer is, and the trackpad works great and doesn't ever make your cursor jump while you're typing.  Battery life is excellent at around 7 hours.  I'm not necessarily a fan of Apple the corporation, but I am a fan of great quality hardware and a solid UNIX-based OS.",5.0
1110651,B005CWJB5G,"I want to like this laptop for what it is: an unbelievably smooth, lightweight, fast computer.  Unfortunately I've had to exchange this device three times, each time seemingly better than the last but not without problems.  Suffice it to say the first unit had dead pixels, the second wasn't properly sealed and the bottom would creak when used.  The third and longest lasting of the group is fine except for two issues: it doesn't stay asleep (randomly knocking me off IM conversations on my desktop) and it constantly has issues with the audio wherein things that should make sound do not.  The system makes noise, like when adjusting volume levels, but frequently Adium or Chrome or another application will just not play sounds.  Couple this with AirPlay audio randomly failing and I'm not that pleased.  Only a reboot seems to fix the issue.  This appears to be documented as an issue with the OS, but doesn't affect everyone so it's hard to say.It's minor in of itself but when it happens nearly on a daily basis I'm a bit put off.  So I'm going to try my 4th and final unit.  If the issues persist I'll drop my review, if not then it's a 5 star winner.Pros:++Lightweight++Fantastic battery life+Fast, thanks to SSD+Backlit keyboard+Amazing trackpadCons:-Edges are a bit sharp, can be painful to hold in certain circumstances-Bottom is aluminum so it can and will slide on your lap--Build quality and buggy software that should have been fixed by nowOS is a draw for me, I like Windows better for some things (gaming, file management), MacOS for other things (photography, general browsing).

1110652,B005CWJB5G,"I was looking for a replacement for my big 15"" laptop and decided to go for an ultraportable this time around. I like the brute power and screen resolution of larger laptops, but have seen new ultrabooks that rival those in even those areas. That sold me, especially coupled with the fact that I'm tired of carrying around a 6+ pound machine.Most consider Apple to be a premium, expensive but aesthetically-pleasing brand, and in most respects they are. However, at this point in time the MacBook Air 13"" is really not a bad deal from a hardware standpoint. I did a lot of looking and spec-reading, and it simply looked the best from a cost/performance standpoint. The fact that it looks cool and is Apple branded is just icing on the cake. My next choice was the high-end ASUS Zenbook. Toshiba and HP's offerings also caught my eye, but were all clearly deficient in at least one area (usually CPU) in order to boost battery life. I understand the tradeoff, but I'd rather have 10% more CPU power than 10% more battery life.In comparison to the Zenbook, the Mac Air has a smaller capacity SSD for equivalent price, and slightly lower resolution screen. However, it's got a faster processor and SSD. I'll admit that the last one is a bit subjective since they're both pretty fast and are running different operating systems, but that is my judgment based on familiarity with Win 7 and OS X 10.7 boot times on similar hardware. What decided it for me hardware-wise was the keyboard. The Mac Air has essentially the same keyboard as the 15"" Mac Pro, and it's probably the best laptop keyboard ever made. The Zenbook... well, it's different. I guess some might not mind it, but I kind of do. Additionally, the 256 vs 128 GB of SSD space is not a significant difference the way I look at it. If I'm going to be storing massive files like videos, I'd use an external USB 3 HDD anyway, and 128 extra GB isn't going to make much difference (especially when you factor in how much larger Win 7 is than OSX).On that note, I'd say it's debatable whether OSX is better than Win 7 overall, and I still use the latter for games and such. However, if I'm not planning on running games I'd say there's little doubt that OSX is more streamlined for general tasks. That's what I'm using this machine for, so I count that a plus.Note- the 'good' one is the base 13"" model. The stock 'high end' one is not a good deal, as all you get is a bigger SSD.Pros:Excellent keyboardOSX 10.7 and iLife (iMovie beats the snot out of Windows Movie Maker)Good performance with turbo-boost i5, GMA 4000 and 4 GB of RAM. Fast SSD.USB 3.0 for fast external data transferScreen has good resolution- better than 13"" MBP and way better than any netbook.Cons:As with all ultrabooks, not easily modifiable or expandable.",5.0
